                <li>Discussed Meeting Dynamics: </br>
                    Meetings should not be mandatory for all to attend for the full duration; some meetings are 
                    centered around subjects all team members are not volunteered to contribute to. 
                    Suggestion is for all people to be present for the first 10 minutes before deciding whether 
                    or not they need to be present; this is more convenient than forcing people to sit in on 1 hour+ 
                    whilst also allowing people to stay up to date with the meeting content in a nutshell.
